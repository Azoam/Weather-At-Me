# Weather-At-Me
Simple weather description based on the public IP address of the machine running the script.

The script itself uses two api's: freegeoip to get a sense of location based on the local ip of the machine the script is being run on and the darksky API to recieve weather information regarding the location found in the previous step.

Of course this script may not work as intended if the machine running the script is using some sort of VPN or any other technology that masks its public IP Address.

This was fun :D
